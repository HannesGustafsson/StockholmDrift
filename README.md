# StockholmDrift
A little racing game, my first C++ project

~---~~~~====<'Stockholm Drift'>====~~~~--

Control the car using WASD.

You gain points for each passing car. 'O'

The multiplier increases number of points gained.

Being higher up and having more fuel increases the multiplier.

Collect fuel '*' before you run empty!

Make sure not to crash though!
